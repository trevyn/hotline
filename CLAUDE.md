- always raise errors or panic instead of assuming a default or using ok() to hide or using a fallback
- crates in the `objects` directory are slim and must not have `build.rs` files or dependencies other than `hotline`
- use alan kay's idea of inter-object messages as "intent tokens", not data passing
- this is a real implementation, don't hard-code things that should be generic
- do not use "get" prefix; e.g. "bounds" method instead of "get_bounds"
- runtime/main should not call any specific objects other than WindowManager
- when working with macros, remember that you can use cargo-expand
