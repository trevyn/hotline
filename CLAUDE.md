- always raise errors or panic instead of assuming a default or using ok() to hide or using a fallback
- crates in the `objects` directory are slim and must generally not have `build.rs` files or dependencies other than `hotline`, unless they are "Loader" or "Application" objects
- use alan kay's idea of inter-object messages as "intent tokens", not data passing
- this is a real implementation, don't hard-code things that should be generic
- do not use "get" prefix; e.g. "bounds" method instead of "get_bounds"
- runtime/main should not call any specific objects other than WindowManager
- when working with macros, remember that you can use cargo-expand, and you can also pipe the expansion into rustc
- adjust the `object` macro if it would help make things cleaner
- error reporting in `hotline-macros` should be done with proc-macro-error's `abort!` instead of panic or expect
- when dealing with symbols, be very attentive to the number of underscores
- when objects use types, these types have proxy types generated by the object macro, they are not "really" the type in question
- Like<T> is basically just a documentation thing to refer to Rect being used as a template for a polymorphic duck-type object. it should be treated the same as T. objects can use either variant as they wish.
- `extern "Rust"` FFI methods CAN be async
- fix warnings as you go
- #[serde(crate = "::hotline::serde")]
- feel free to web search and web fetch
- no general debug logging, but do generously debug log when something doesn't meet expectations
- trace through the code and understand the root cause
- evolve the whole system to be better
